            The Crypto Pops Society is a collection of 5.000 unique Pops with
            64Ã—64 pixel art images, generated algorithmically on the Binance
            Smart Chain (BCS). Most are Human, but there are a few rarer types
            mixed in: Zombies, Animals, Robot and even the odd Constellation.

          <p className="text-slate-500 text-lg pt-6">
            There are exactly 5,000 of them, each with their own ostensible
            personality and unique combination of distinctive, randomly
            generated features.

            Developing blockchain projects is different from conventional
            projects. Developers after announcing and releasing the product will
            almost no longer have the right to interfere and modify. It is the
            investors who will be responsible for the changes they have made to
            the smart contract.

            At the same time, the fixed number of 5,000 Pops makes Pops valuable
            and limited. Even if creators could make more Pops, they would not
            be recognized in the market. This has proven equality and fairness
            for everyone when entering this playground.

            Because once created, the manufacturers locked it up and the
            ownership control code was injected into the BSC blockchain network.
            By the time the Pops are released on the blockchain, the producer
            has lost his control to create more or own the Pops.
